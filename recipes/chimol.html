        Traditionally made from chopped tomato, onion, serrano peppers, salt, lime juice and cilantro.

    <p>With Chimol, Radish is added to give that peppery, nose-clearing spice while also adding some spice or "chile" to get your tongue tingling.
        Can be eaten as a salad or more commonly as a side to complement steak with rice!
